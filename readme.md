# Data Science Journey: 6-Month Learning Project

## Overview

Welcome to my 6â€‘month journey in data science and AI/ML! This repository documents my progress as I build my Python skills to match (and eventually surpass) my PgSQL expertise. My goal is to gain hands-on experience with data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and ultimately, to demystify the inner workings of neural networks and even build a tailored LLM.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets (both synthetic and real-world).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and model building.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation of my progress, project roadmap, and notes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd data-science-journey
   ```
