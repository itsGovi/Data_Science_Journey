Let's kick off Day 3 with a refreshed, integrated focus that blends data analysis with general Python programming. Today, you'll work on two mini-projects: one for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on your employee dataset and another for a small automation tool. Both projects will help you practice your DS skills and general coding, respectively.

---

## **Mini-Project 1: Enhanced EDA on the Employee Dataset**

**Objective:**

Discover trends in your employee dataset by grouping and summarizing numerical data. You'll explore questions like:

* What’s the average base salary per department?
* Which department has the highest billing rate?
* How does utilization (actual vs. target) vary by department?

### **Recipe for Code (with Gaps for You to Fill):**

1. **Group by Department for Average Salary:**
   * Think of this like slicing a cake: each slice represents one department, and you want the average sweetness (salary) of each slice.
   * **Your Task:** Use your DataFrame to group by the `department` column, then calculate the mean of the `base_salary` column.
2. **Identify Department with Highest Billing Rate:**
   * Imagine you’re comparing the tip amounts across restaurant branches to find the branch with the highest average tip.
   * **Your Task:** Group by `department` and find which one has the highest average `billing_rate`.
   * *Hint:* You might compute the mean billing rate per department, then find the maximum value.
3. **Utilization Variation Across Departments:**
   * Picture a set of performance reviews where you compare how closely each department meets its targets.
   * **Your Task:** For each department, calculate both the mean and standard deviation for `actual_utilization` and `utilization_target`.
   * *Hint:* Use an aggregation function (like `agg()`) to compute multiple statistics at once.

**Puzzle Challenge:**

Fill in the missing steps in your code (using your previous knowledge and intuition) to answer these questions. Document your thought process and experiment with different parameters if needed.

## **Mini-Project 2: A Small Automation Tool**

**Objective:**

Build a simple command-line tool that performs a repetitive task—like organizing files in a directory or parsing a log file. This project focuses on general Python programming.

### **Recipe for Code (with Gaps for You to Fill):**

1. **Define the Task:**
   * Example: Write a tool that scans a folder, lists all file names, and groups them by file extension (like sorting laundry into different baskets).
   * **Your Task:**
     * Use Python's built-in modules (like `os` and `collections`) to access and process file names.
2. **Structure Your Code:**
   * Break the process into functions:
     * One function to list files in a directory.
     * One function to group these files by extension.
   * **Your Task:** Sketch out a plan on paper or in comments, then start writing your functions step by step.
3. **Iterative Feedback:**
   * As you build your tool, run it on a test folder and adjust your code based on the output.
   * **Challenge:** Consider adding options (like a command-line argument to choose the directory).

**Puzzle Challenge:**

Fill in the gaps in your automation tool’s code. Experiment with different ways to group the files and refine your functions. Aim to write clean, modular code that you can reuse later.

## **Reflection and Next Steps**

* **For the EDA project:**
  * Reflect on how grouping and aggregation in Pandas compare to SQL queries you’ve written.
  * Write down any insights you gain (e.g., which department has the most variability in utilization).
* **For the Automation Tool:**
  * Consider how the modular functions you write might be combined into a small, complete application.
  * Note any challenges in working with file paths, handling errors, or making your code flexible.

**Your Action:**

1. Implement both mini-projects in your Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
2. Experiment by filling in the gaps in the provided recipes and adding your own creative touches.
3. Document your process and any questions you encounter.

By blending these projects today, you'll strengthen your DS skills and boost your general programming proficiency—key for any role that values Python expertise. Happy coding on Day 3!
