You're essentially looking to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on numerical columns in a structured way. Let's break this down into steps that match your preferred methodology:

### **1. Define the Objective**

You want to extract meaningful insights from numerical columns by  **grouping** ,  **analyzing distributions** , and  **checking correlations** . Your goal is to uncover patterns such as:

* Salary differences across departments
* Utilization trends
* Performance score impact on flight risk

---

### **2. Identify Relevant Numerical Columns**

Based on your dataset (HR/Employee data), numerical columns likely include:

* `base_salary`
* `billing_rate`
* `performance_score`
* `actual_utilization`
* `utilization_target`
* `flight_risk` (if numeric)

---

### **3. Break Down the Analysis into Components**

#### **(A) Grouping and Aggregation**

**Purpose:** Compare metrics across different employee attributes.

Think of this as **slicing your data** to see how numerical values behave for different categories.

ðŸ”¹ **By Department**

* What's the average salary per department?
* Which department has the highest billing rate?
* Does utilization vary significantly across departments?

ðŸ”¹ **By Position Level**

* Do senior employees have significantly higher base salaries?
* Are higher-level employees more utilized than juniors?

ðŸ”¹ **By Performance Score**

* Do high performers have better salaries?
* Is high performance linked to lower flight risk?

âœ… **Your task:** Write queries or `.groupby()` operations to compute mean, median, and std deviation for each of these cases.

---

#### **(B) Percentiles for Salary & Performance Score**

**Purpose:** Instead of just looking at averages, percentiles help identify salary gaps and outliers.

ðŸ”¹ **What to check?**

* Compute **percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th)** for salaries.
* Compare the distribution between different groups.
* See if any group has a **wide salary gap** (e.g., within a department).

âœ… **Your task:**

Use `np.percentile()` or `.quantile([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9])` on key numerical columns and interpret the spread.

---

#### **(C) Correlation Analysis**

**Purpose:** Find hidden relationships between numerical columns.

* Does a higher salary mean higher utilization?
* Are high performers getting paid more?
* Does high flight risk correlate with low performance?

âœ… **Your task:**

* Compute the  **correlation matrix (`df.corr()`)** .
* Identify  **strong correlations (> 0.5 or < -0.5)** .
* Visualize with a heatmap (`seaborn.heatmap()`).

---

### **4. Iterative Discovery**

Once you've done these analyses, **look for unexpected patterns** and drill deeper. For example:

* If high performers **don't** have higher salaries â†’ investigate why.
* If flight risk **isn't correlated** with performance â†’ check if other factors matter.
