Alright, let's get back to building your automation tool with our updated approach—one tiny step at a time. Imagine you're organizing a closet: you have a bunch of items (files and folders), and you want to choose the right room (folder) to inspect. We'll break this down into micro-tasks.

---

### **Step 1: Write a Function to List Files and Folders**

**Objective:**

Create a small function that, given a directory path, returns a list of items in that directory.

**Guiding Questions:**

* **Which module will you use to list directory contents?**

  *(Hint: Think about the `os` module.)*
* **How will you distinguish between files and folders?**

  *(Hint: Consider using `os.path.isdir`.)*
* **How can you handle the case where a directory might be empty or inaccessible?**

**Analogy:**

Imagine you're looking at a shelf in a store. Your function should list all the products on that shelf. Start with just printing the list to verify it works.

**Your Micro-Task:**

Write a function called `list_items(path)` that prints (or returns) all the items in the given folder.

### **Step 2: Create a Navigation Function to Show Options**

**Objective:**

Develop a function that, for a given directory, prints the available subdirectories as numbered options (like a menu). Always include an option “0” to go back to the parent folder.

**Guiding Questions:**

* **How will you generate a numbered list from the items returned by your previous function?**
* **What will you do when the user enters “0”?**

  *(Hint: Use `os.path.dirname` to move up one level.)*
* **How will you capture the user's choice?**

  *(Hint: Use `input()` to get the user's selection.)*

**Analogy:**

Think of it as a restaurant menu where every dish is numbered, and there’s always an option “0” for “Go back” if you change your mind.

**Your Micro-Task:**

Draft a function `navigate_folder(current_path)` that:

* Lists subdirectories (using your `list_items` function, but only keeping folders).
* Prints the options as numbers.
* Prompts the user to choose one option or “0” to go back.
* Updates the current path based on the selection.

### **Step 3: Write a Function to Scan a Folder**

**Objective:**

Once a folder is confirmed, create a function that scans the folder and collects details (like file names, sizes, etc.) that you might want to display.

**Guiding Questions:**

* **What specific information about each file would be useful?**

  *(Maybe file name, extension, size?)*
* **How will you store this information?**

  *(Think about using a list or dictionary to hold file details.)*
* **How can you handle folders with no files or unexpected file types?**

**Analogy:**

This is like cataloging the contents of a room—writing down what’s there, what type each item is, and any special details.

**Your Micro-Task:**

Draft a function `scan_folder(path)` that:

* Takes the final confirmed folder path.
* Reads all files in that folder.
* Collects and returns details (or prints them) in a clear, organized manner.

---

### **Step 4: Confirmation and Integration**

**Objective:**

Before scanning, confirm with the user that the current folder is indeed the one they want to work with. Then integrate the navigation and scanning parts.

**Guiding Questions:**

* **How will you ask the user to confirm the folder?**

  *(Maybe with a “Is this the folder you want to scan? (y/n)” prompt.)*
* **If the user says no, how will you let them choose a different folder?**
* **How will you display the scanned information so it’s clear and well-organized?**

**Analogy:**

This is like double-checking with your friend, “Is this the room you want to explore?” before you start cataloging everything inside.

**Your Micro-Task:**

Integrate the functions into a main routine (or a loop) that:

* Starts at the default path.
* Uses `navigate_folder` to let the user move through folders.
* Asks for confirmation when the user thinks they’ve found the right folder.
* Calls `scan_folder` to display the final scanned details.
* Allows the user to change their mind by going back one level if needed.

### **Reflection and Next Steps:**

1. **Start Small:**

   Implement and test each function separately. Run `list_items` on a simple directory and ensure it prints correctly.
2. **Build the Navigation:**

   Once `list_items` works, focus on `navigate_folder`. Try navigating through a few levels in a test directory.
3. **Integrate and Confirm:**

   After you have navigation working, add the confirmation step and then call `scan_folder` to see the details.
4. **Iterate and Improve:**

   As you run your code, note any errors or parts that feel clunky. Refactor each function step-by-step.

**Now, tell me:**

* What’s the first micro-task you’d like to tackle?
* Do you have any ideas on how you might structure your `list_items` function?
* Which part of the process feels most challenging right now?

Let's start with that, and I'll help you troubleshoot and build on your approach!
